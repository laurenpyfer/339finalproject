                <p>I paint and draw because I love creating images that I haven't seen before; ideas 
                that build up in my head, based on very real things in front of me, combined with my experiences 
                and imagination. These ideas marinate and smolder until I am ready to put pen to paper.  
                Drawing is as much who I am as a person, as any other identifying characteristic. 
                 It has always been something I strive to become better at while enjoying doing so.  </p>

                 <div class="aboutme">
                    <p>Art is the language I like best, and it's the language I use to tell my story. And just like a writer, I permit myself to let it change in meaning and develop as I go. 
                        Memories often inspire my art. I usually begin painting after finding a reminder of my past. Little sketches or photographs act as a catalyst to a process of remembering. When I paint from memory, ideas begin to flow, and scenes emerge that are much more descriptive than what I could preserve in writing. Layer after layer, I use the canvas to develop my story and shape my past. 
                        I began my most recent painting after finding an old drawing of Tennessee Valley Beach, a place from my childhood. I recall the vibrancy of the colors, the shapes the land created, and the movement within the landscape. As I paint, I go back to the little sketch I made and the memories and emotions it brings forth. I visualize how the red-tinged rocks juxtaposed the yellowing plants that overwhelm the vegetation. I remember the turquoise of the ocean and feel the icy cold water as it takes my breath away. I swear I can smell the salty air that burns my throat and hear the laughter of my brothers chasing me up the trail.
                        The story that develops on the page makes the painting more than just a snapshot in time of a pretty place. It's a chronicle of how I saw or imagined things to be, not exactly how they were. I paint not only what I remember, but what was there past the surface; what I sensed, heard, and believed.  
                        Some people have journals. I have my canvases. My paintings unravel to represent more than just the 2D image depicting an event from my past. Each creation is a collection of emotions, places, and people and represents a unique memory brought back to life.
